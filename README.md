# james-cooperation-application-
this sort of thing where it redirects to a roblox game and some other junk and nothign else

if you're wondering why you're reading this then this is how to actually run the thing

to make it work, try to allow AutoIt on your computer as this "application" is powered by it (we had other plans of making it with Lua but you can't make literally anything with it)

that's all for now
